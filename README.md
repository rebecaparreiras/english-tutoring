# English Tutoring

The website Pri Figueiredo | English Tutoring was developed for the teacher Pri Figueiredo and her students' classes.

As a former Pri's student, we had shared many discussions about her ideal website, and the design presented is the final result.

The teacher's main wishes were: a website that reflects her personality, with dark background, colorful and the use of round borders. Besides, she wanted the navigation to be easy and intuitive.
