                                    My method was developed by me over years of teaching. 
                                    I can say that the lessons always try to touch on all the skills - 
                                    speaking, writing, reading, grammar, listening and vocabulary. 
                                    It's also worth noting here that something essential in our classes is that 
                                    we don't “translate” from English into Portuguese.

                                    First of all: you'll never graduate in English - if you're not studying Literature. 
                                    Practicing any language must be constant and disciplined; you can get a proficiency 
                                    diploma, but if you don't practice, two years later you'll be speaking like an 
                                    intermediate student again. That said, the time it takes you to evolve is very 
                                    much down to your dedication, commitment, attendance and effort. We teachers are 
                                    just facilitators.
